									<span>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING</span>
									<h1>Named Entity Recognition on Indonesian Accident News</h1>
									<p>Conduct Research to extract named entities from Indonesian accident news using advanced natural language processing techniques.</p>
								</header>
								<section>
									<p>The rapid development of technology has revolutionized communication 
										and information dissemination, particularly through online news 
										portals. These portals serve as the primary source of information, 
										including updates on accidents. However, retrieving crucial and 
										relevant information from lengthy accident news articles, especially 
										in the Indonesian language, can be time-consuming. In this project, 
										I aim to conduct research to extract named entities from accident 
										news using advanced natural language processing techniques.</p>
									<br><h2>Objective</h2>
									<p>The objective of this project is to develop a model capable of 
										automatically detecting and extracting named entities from accident 
										news articles. The proposed methodology combines the power of 
										Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) and Conditional 
										Random Field (CRF) methods to accurately identify relevant entities.</p>
									<br><h2>Methodology</h2>
									<ol>
										<li><b>Data Collection:</b> I collected a dataset consisting of Indonesian accident news articles from the year 2022, obtained from various Indonesian news portals using web scraping method.</li>
										<li><b>Preprocessing:</b> The collected data undergo preprocessing steps such as text cleaning, tokenization, and labeling of named entities.</li>
										<li><b>Feature Extraction:</b> Relevant features are extracted from the preprocessed text, capturing important linguistic patterns and contextual information.</li>
										<li><b>Model Training:</b> I train the BiLSTM-CRF model using the labeled data, leveraging the network's ability to capture both forward and backward dependencies in the text.</li>
										<li><b>Evaluation Metrics:</b> I employ accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance in identifying named entities within accident reports.</li>
									</ol>
									<br><h2>Results</h2>
									<p>The research project resulted in a model that successfully detected 
										named entities in accident news articles. The model achieved an 
										accuracy value of 87.97%, indicating a high level of overall 
										correctness. The precision value was 89.09%, suggesting a low rate 
										of false positive predictions. The recall performance resulted in 
										87.23%, indicating a good ability to identify true positive entities. 
										The F1-score reached 88.34%, indicating a robust balance between 
										precision and recall.</p>
									<br><h2>Significance and Applications</h2>
									<p>The developed model will provide a valuable tool for automating the 
										extraction of relevant information from accident news articles. 
										By accurately identifying named entities, such as locations, dates, 
										and involved parties, the model will streamline the process of 
										retrieving crucial information from these reports. The application 
										of this technology has the potential to enhance various domains, 
										including emergency response management, insurance claim processing, 
										and accident analysis in the Indonesian context.</p>
									<br><h2>Conclusion</h2>
									<p>This research project successfully utilized advanced natural language 
										processing techniques, specifically the combination of BiLSTM and CRF, 
										for extracting named entities in Indonesian accident news articles. 
										The obtained results demonstrated the efficacy of the developed 
										model in identifying relevant entities in the Indonesian language. 
										The proposed methodology opens up new avenues for improving 
										information retrieval from Indonesian online news portals, providing 
										valuable insights into accidents and their associated details in the 
										Indonesian context. As the author of this project, I am proud to 
										present these real results and contribute to the advancement of 
										natural language processing in the field of Indonesian accident news 
										analysis.</p>
